      However, the salaries for players linked to the two organizations have a stark difference. Men make a lot more
      income from their job (playing) with the NBA than women make for their job with the WNBA. But does this necessarily 
      mean that women are being discriminated against in the sports world? From the 3rd chart we can see that the viewership 
      and ratings are significantly higher for the NBA compared to the WNBA. Therefore, the NBA gets better sponsorships
      and can afford to pay their players higher salaries than the WNBA. Thus, we can conclude that there is no 
      statistically significant discrimination against women from their organization. However, the societal
      conditioning and sexism makes men's games more interesting to the viewers. This means that sexism prevails
      in sports because of the "customers" i.e., audience. There are not many things the organizations can do to make
      women's sports more appealing to the audience. Hopefully, things will change, and people will willingly watch a
      sport regardless of the players' genders."),

          1.	NBA and WNBA have similar quality players.

          3.	NBA has a higher viewership than WNBA, and thus has a greater income."),

        Are the ratings different because sports is considered male entertainment? Men like games better when men are playing?")
